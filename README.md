It may be useful for companies to figure out where underserved markets for solar installation exist when compared to that market's power consumption. It is arguable easier to sell local power generation prodcuts to those consuming a lot of it. This comparision is created by looking at Crux Eurostat - Final Energy Consumption in Households Per Capita and Eurostat - Solar Thermal Collectors' Surface to see what areas that consume large amounts of power don't have significant solar generation products.
